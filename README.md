11.8.2018<br>
Nicholas Crombie-<br> initiated express/node/mongoose packets, models built. I started building the controllers and will presume they will use basic CRUD functions in all models. need to check with Kyler/Tom about whether controllers will be necessary for all models/relations. need to check with kyler/tom or troy about relational data.<br><br>

11.26.18
Matthew Denholm-<br> Session controller should have basic CRUD functionality. Views need to be hooked up still to confirm this.

12.04.18
Matthew Denholm-<br> Session and Participant are fully functional on CRUD. Can be prettied up later.

12.12.2018 FINAL REPORT
Nicholas Crombie-
PURPOSE:
  The purpose of this project was to create a system that will handle the K-State twist registration and scheduling. Students would register for topics they are interested in and systematically fill in registered students into the scheduled sessions based on their interest.
FEATURES:
  Ability for students and presenters to register with their topics of interest or professional background. Have the ability to view the upcoming schedule.
DESIGN DECISION:
  As a whole we felt the table format for showing the schedule was an efficient form.
PROBLEMS/CHALLENGES:
  The personal challenges I had was getting ralational data to save to the datastructure in the database. For example topics being pulled in to the create/update page would not save or update when submitted leaving them blank.
